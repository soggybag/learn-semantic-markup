	This is a blockquote. As a quote that stands apart rather being part of another block of text. 

	There are two parts. 

	- The quoted text
	- the attribution

	The quoted text looks like single paragraph. 
	Notice the beginning an ending quotation mark. These are special characters. 
	To display these you'll use an HTML entity. 
	An html entity is a pattern of characters used to display special characters. 
	Special characters are characters that might have special meaning in code. 

	For example: < and > have special meaning since we use these to make tags. 

	To display these as part of the content use: &lt; and &gt;

	An entity starts with & (ampersand) and ends with ; (semicolon)

	Between the & and ; have a pattern of characters that name the entity.
