to be a captive of the environment in which you first 
find yourself.”

	Special characters are characters that might have special meaning in code. 

	For example: < and > have special meaning since we use these to make tags. 

	To display these as part of the content use: &lt; and &gt;

	An entity starts with & (ampersand) and ends with ; (semicolon)

	Between the & and ; have a pattern of characters that name the entity.
