	<p>
		<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the standard markup language 
		for creating web pages and web applications. With <abbr title="Cascading Style 
		Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone 
		technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]
	</p>
	<p>
		Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
		local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
		HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
		originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
