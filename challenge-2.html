Hypertext Markup Language

From wikimedia

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language 
for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style 
Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone 
technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and 
originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
